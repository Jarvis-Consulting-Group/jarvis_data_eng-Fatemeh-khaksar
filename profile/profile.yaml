summary:  At Payame Noor University, I finished my undergraduate degree in computer engineering in 2011. Since September 2011 to the present, I have been working as a computer support in an educational institution. I had the opportunity to deal with a variety of people during my professional career to support them in registering for training courses and also educate junior pupils, which enabled me to improve my communication skills.I've been in responsible for supporting the installation or upgrade of roughly 30 PCs as needed. Occasionally, creating some type of brochure for special occasions has helped me become familiar with Adobe Photoshop.
