Using Dataproc, we set up a Hadoop cluster on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which allowed us to manage and extend our resources as necessary. To tackle particular business issues, we used Apache Hive and the Zeppelin Notebook, practicing various HiveQL queries and evaluating the effectiveness of various approaches.",
